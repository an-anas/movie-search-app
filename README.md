# The Movie search engine
## Description
The Movie Search engine allows users to search for movies and view the results. This application was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It uses an API provided by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to retrieve movie data.  
**You can view a live version of the application [here](https://ananas-tmse.netlify.app/).**
## Installation

To use this application, you need to have your own API key from OMDb. You can get one for free [here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). Once you have your API key, you can add it to the application by creating a file called .env.local in the root directory of the application. In the .env.local file, add the following line:
```VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY```
replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.
